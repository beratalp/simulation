Algorithm
=========

This simulator have 4 layers. The GUI, that designed in QT; for easy to use. You can browse designs from source codes.
PyGame layer, modeling, simulating and animating the simulation. I used pygame cuz' it's easy and dev-friendly. Why bother to building my graphic motor, ha? :D
SciPy layer, for making arithmetic operations easily and quickly.
And the Python, I love Python because it's so dev-friendly and fast. If I will have things that making in Python is impossible, I can even use C++.

You can find full algorithm in source code.
